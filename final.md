## *ME*: how to config .gitignore to determine which file not to push  
## *GPT-3.5*: 

To determine which files to ignore when pushing to a Git repository, you need to create a .gitignore file in the root directory of your Git repository. Here’s how to do it:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your Git repository, and run the following command to create a new .gitignore file:

```
touch .gitignore
```

2. Open the .gitignore file in a text editor of your choice and add the names of the files, directories, or file patterns that you want to ignore. For example:

```
# Ignore files with the extension .txt
*.txt

# Ignore files in a specific directory
my_directory/

# Ignore all files in a directory except one
my_directory/*
!my_directory/important_file.txt

# Ignore files that contain a specific word
*foo*
```

3. Save and close the .gitignore file.

4. Commit the .gitignore file to your Git repository:

```
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Added .gitignore file"
```

Now, when you push changes to your Git repository, the files, directories, or file patterns that you’ve added to the .gitignore file will be excluded from the push.
